#Hi Thanks for checking out my poster

The marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is an elusive tree-nesting sea bird found along the Pacific coast of North America whose old-growth nesting habitat has declined in size over the last century. Mapping the remaining nesting habitat is a core step in the conservation of this Species at Risk with fine-scale mapping efforts expected to be enhanced by the inclusion of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data, which can provide quantitative measures of forest structure for birds. This study presents results from an ALS informed habitat model for marbled murrelet nest sites on the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia, using three ecologically relevant forest structure predictors: tree height, canopy surface area, and the volume of gaps under the canopy. Two different modeling approaches - ensembles of small models (ESMs) and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) - were used to link 63 nest locations with ALS data at a 100 m2 resolution after masking known non-habitat and disturbed areas. The ESM and Maxent models showed good discrimination from random background points with AUC scores of 0.742 and 0.738 respectively, and Boyce indexes above 0.9 showing that higher-ranked habitat was preferentially selected for in the landscape. These results align with other ALS marbled murrelet habitat models in the United States with similar accuracy and ecological conclusions. This study offers a quantitative way to predict sites with potential nesting habitat for an elusive Species at Risk using a parsimonious set of ecologically relevant predictors and a modeling framework that can accommodate low sample sizes.
